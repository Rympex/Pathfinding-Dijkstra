This allows you to use simple, MoveTo ("MapName") instead of using 1000 elseif

KantoMap: Most is done with exceptions
JohtoMap: Done 1% (i do not have accounts with full johto)
HoeenMap: Done 0% (I have not seen this map)

To do:

add the requirements for maps
Example: route 17 is only used if you have the mount in the inventory
