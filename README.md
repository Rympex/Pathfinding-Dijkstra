This allows you to use simple, MoveTo ("MapName") instead of using 1000 elseif

KantoMap: Most is done with exceptions

JohtoMap: Done 1% (i do not have accounts with full johto)

HoeenMap: Done 0% (I have not seen this map)

To do:

+Add the requirements for maps (Example: route 17 is only used if you have the mount in the inventory) 75% done

+Add the Auto-Harvest (Berry - Hidden Items - Items) can be Disable with [AutoHarvest = False] 25% done

Done:

+Add the MemoryPath (Store in memory path already calc, for speedup the process) 100% done <Testing>
